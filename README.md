# R1	Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.

As an avid reader I've always cherished the joy of flipping through pages, getting lost in various worlds and learning about the world around me. However, I can't help but acknowledge the challenges associated with this passion, chief among which is accessibility. 

Sometimes visiting a traditional library becomes a tough task due to various constraints (location, time etc.), and an option to conveniently borrow physical books as opposed to simply purchasing them would be great. More importantly, the range of books available at any given library may not align with any one individual's diverse and ever-evolving reading interests.

Reflecting on this, I've realised that there are mini-libraries tucked away in homes all across every city. People's personal book collections often house a diverse range of books, from bestsellers and classics to the more obscure, under-the-radar literature. This is all the more so for non-fiction texts, some of which may be obscure and hard to source, in my experience. 

Each bookshelf is a unique reflection of the reader's journey and taste. These collections are of great benefit to the wider community of readers, and indeed I have seen an analog version of this where people construct bookshelf cabinets along their fence with a sign to “take a book and leave a book” as such. This realisation gave rise to the idea of my current project - a platform designed to bridge this gap, making these personal book collections accessible to everyone.

# R2	Why is it a problem that needs solving?

By building this app, I aim to solve the problem of limited accessibility to diverse reading materials in a more decentralised manner, fostering an engaged, interactive community of book lovers. Traditional avenues for accessing books like libraries, bookstores, and digital platforms, certainly have their merits, but they also come with inherent limitations.

I think the first is physical space, bookstores and libraries can only house a certain number of books. This can result in both a lack of diversity and availability, especially when it comes to less mainstream literature. For example, books from indie authors, foreign language works, or region-specific literature may not always be readily available in these traditional avenues.

Secondly, libraries operate on a lending model that often includes strict time limits. If a reader needs more time with a book or needs to revisit it later, they might find the book has been returned to the circulation and isn't immediately available.

Bookstores, on the other hand, require you to purchase books. While this isn't necessarily a problem for everyone, it does pose a barrier for those who can't afford to continually buy new books, especially considering the often high prices of newly released titles or special editions.

Lastly, while digital platforms like Audible provide a great service, they don't cater to those who prefer physical books. While I personally do consume audiobooks, many readers enjoy the tactile experience of reading a physical book, the feel of the pages, the smell of the book, the satisfaction of physically turning a page, something which digital platforms can't replicate.

Through this app, users can share their personal libraries, making their books available to others in their vicinity. Similarly, they can access books from other users' collections, and request them.  It can provide a more diverse range of books in any sizable city, foster a community spirit among readers, and, importantly, ensures that the joy of reading remains accessible to everyone. This platform not only solves the issue of accessibility but also fosters a community of like-minded readers, making the world a bigger place for these people, and also fostering connection and community, something I believe is all the more important these days. The joy of reading should be more readily accessible to everyone.
